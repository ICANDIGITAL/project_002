Project Abstract
Team Terminatorâ€™s project this year will focus on developing a Chess playing robot that relies on camera inputs to identify a chess board and a mechanical arm to move the chess pieces. Machine learning principles will be used to produce ideal victory paths for the system as well. This project aims to cover various engineering fields and expose participants to long term research in addition to applied and collaborative engineering environments. While a robot that can play a game of chess on its own is the end goal, we will be adopting a milestone build pattern, first starting with the game of Tic Tac Toe and slowly incorporating new features to allow for the slightly more complicated game of chess. This is an attempt to breach the any gaps that may exist in the experience levels of the participants. The project will have, at minimum, a mechanical, an electrical, and a programming aspect to it, with the electrical aspect involving mostly small dc circuitry and the mechanical aspect comprising schematic design and assembly. Thus, the hazards are fairly minimal. Nevertheless, the team will be under the supervision of Dr. Charles J. Kim (VIP Team Advisor) and the oversight of Chidi M. Ekeocha (Graduate assistant).
